# Ika-Script
A collection of user scripts and custom styles written for the browsergame "Ikariam". 
It currently consists of the following scripts:

- Ikariam map enhancer
- Ikariam island view enhancer
- Ikariam navigation enhancer
- Ikariam report enhancer
- Ikariam piracy helper
- a custom style sheet for removing some UI clutter

*All userscripts were tested with the tampermonkey extension v4.17 for Firefox. Custom style can be applied for example via the Stylus extension.*
