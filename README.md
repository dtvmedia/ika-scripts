# Ika-Script
A collection of user scripts and custom styles written for the browsergame "Ikariam". 
It currently consists of the following scripts:

- [Ikariam map enhancer](https://github.com/dtvmedia/ika-scripts/raw/master/src/js/map-enhancer.user.js)
- [Ikariam island view enhancer](https://github.com/dtvmedia/ika-scripts/raw/master/src/js/island-view-enhancer.user.js)
- [Ikariam navigation enhancer](https://github.com/dtvmedia/ika-scripts/raw/master/src/js/navigation-enhancer.user.js)
- [Ikariam report enhancer](https://github.com/dtvmedia/ika-scripts/blob/master/src/js/report-enhancer.user.js)
- [Ikariam piracy helper](https://github.com/dtvmedia/ika-scripts/raw/master/src/js/pirates-helper.user.js)
- a custom style sheet for removing some UI clutter

*All userscripts were tested with the tampermonkey extension v4.17 for Firefox. Custom style can be applied for example via the Stylus extension.*
